# cs546-group47-FinalProject

This is Final Group Project for CS-546.
Our web application is named 'Entrepot', which is an online system for our customers to exchange their second-hand or any stuff they don't need any more to other customers.

In our platform, every user could be a seller and buyer at the same time. Moreover, they have rights to withdraw their product exchange posts, choose a trust buyer as they want, negotiate with another trader they want to buy or sell with.

We, as the developers, will be not involved into the trade process. We only provide the platform for someone who needs it.
